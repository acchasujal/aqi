# Project Progress Log

Append-only chronological record. Do not rewrite old entries. Each entry must say what changed, what was actually run, exact test status, outputs, blockers and next action. A plan is not a completed task.

## 2026-11-06 — Repository bootstrap and initial strategy

- **Task:** Establish repository documentation and agent workflow.
- **Completed:** Initial project brief, data audit notes, evaluation/rules conflict register, baseline-first architecture, modelling plan, validation protocol, external-data policy, experiment tracker, submission controls, agent instructions and task prompts prepared.
- **Evidence available:** Initial uploaded Train/Test/SampleSubmission/Stations/DataDictionary/AdditionalHistory files; Claude's plan and validation code archive; starter notebook listed but Claude reported it had not opened it. Previous assistant file audit and experiments are prior evidence, not a substitute for reproducible repo runs.
- **Not completed:** Weather API retrieval and weather ablation; full-target model comparison; year-over-year feature experiment; independent reproduction of every reported LightGBM fold; organiser rule clarification; final 9/10 November training refresh.
- **Test status:** No project test suite is claimed as passing by this documentation pack.
- **Next actions:** (1) Add official raw data files to `data/raw/challenge/`; (2) run schema/data audit from repo code; (3) port/verify baseline scripts with relative paths; (4) obtain organiser clarification; (5) run year-lag ablation; (6) run permitted archived weather forecast-vintage ablation.

## Bootstrap asset inventory

- Preserved Claude's initial plan under `reports/initial_research/`.
- Preserved six portable legacy validation scripts under `scripts/legacy_validation/` with explicit limitations.
- Included an ECMWF IFS Single Runs fetch prototype under `scripts/`; live API behaviour, terms and full historical coverage remain unverified.
- Added `pyproject.toml` and `configs/default.yaml` as initial setup/config scaffolds; CLI commands in docs are target interfaces until implementation exists.

### 2026-11-06 — Initialize and organize repository
- **Task / issue:** Move the bootstrap project into the existing Git repository and verify the challenge files before baseline reproduction.
- **Agent / owner:** Codex
- **Branch / commit:** `codex/initialize-organize-aqi` / pending
- **Files changed:** Project files moved from `mumbai_pm25_repo_bootstrap/` to the repository root; six challenge inputs moved to `data/raw/challenge/`; starter notebook moved to `notebooks/reference/`; added `reports/initial_research/REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2026-11-06.md`; updated `experiments/EXPERIMENT_LOG.csv` and this log.
- **Work completed:** Verified 47,849 Train rows, 2,592 Test and SampleSubmission rows, exact ordered ID match, no blank or duplicate station/timestamp keys, audited `mean` duplication, extrema, station counts and scoring-block counts. All six raw input SHA-256 values match before and after moving.
- **Commands run:** `git switch -c codex/initialize-organize-aqi`; PowerShell `Move-Item` operations; `Get-FileHash ... -Algorithm SHA256`; Python 3.15.1 and Python 3.12.10 runtime checks; Python standard-library CSV audit; `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install "numpy>=1.26,<3" "pandas>=2.1,<3"` (failed on pandas source build: Visual Studio Build Tools unavailable); `git diff --check`.
- **Tests and exact results:** Data-integrity audit passed. `git diff --check` passed before staging. Project tests not run; no modeling code changed. Baseline metrics not produced.
- **Experiment IDs / metrics:** `EXP-20261106-001` not run; blocked by unavailable pandas Windows ARM64 wheel/build toolchain. Audit details and fingerprints in `reports/initial_research/REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2026-11-06.md`.
- **Decisions added or superseded:** None.
- **Known limitations / blockers:** The existing project's baseline pipeline depends on pandas; find a compatible interpreter/wheel or a supported build environment before reproducing it.
- **Next action:** Reproduce `EXP-20261106-001` on an environment supported by `pyproject.toml`, saving row-level predictions and full-target metrics.
